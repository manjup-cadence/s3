# Introduction
{: .no_toc }


XAF has some specific configuration parameters that can be defined in config file.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Xtensa Audio Framework (XAF) is a framework designed to accelerate the development of audio
processing applications for the HiFi family of DSP cores. Application developers may choose
components from the rich portfolio of audio and speech libraries already developed by Cadence®
and its ecosystem partners. In addition, customers can also package their proprietary algorithms
and components and integrate them into the framework. Towards this goal, a simplified
“Developer API” is defined, which enables application developers to rapidly create an end
application and focus more on using the available components. XAF is designed to work on both
the instruction set simulator as well as actual hardware.
